		<p>Bladee - the only man in the world who is so drained he came into the world fluent in C#, and makes whole albums using only the Cm note</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Andrew\Documents\ANDREW\CODE\PROJECTS\STKV1.1 - draingang x swdev x eyerape\memes\ucancallmebladeetoo.jpg" alt="tfw mom wont let u wrist cry" width="300" height="300">
        <p>
            The true hits by Bladee are songs like Subaru, Skin, My Magic is strong, Ghost Hands, Best Buy, Facetime and 
			Reborn. You can keep listening to Bones and other Soundcloud rappers If you so desire but you wont understand
			a thing about being fully Drained. You’re just a poser and you can go fuck yourself. DG’s art is the purest
			form of music and it isn’t meant for peasants like you, but for the self destructive misanthropes who don’t 
			care about clowns like you. Dg’s music is for the elite and that means it’s out of you reach. None of you will
			understand the true meaning of being Drained. You’re all just a bunch of cringeworthy little children. Our world
			view is externally based on being Drained 247 and on a personal level it relies on listening Gluee backwards 
			twice a day. Without a solid comprehension about theoretical crypto currency it’s meaningless to think that
			you could understand the Drain world view. None of you will understand Drainism because you are all intellectually 
			at the same level as maggots. None of you will reach the altar of the Drain so why are you even thinking about
			it. Bladee and Drainism are for the real elite. For the real misanthropes.

            I mastered programming within hours. I wrote my OWN versions of the two most popular programs in the world.
			The first is Hello World. While rudimentary, and lacking in threading capabilities, it boasts an extremely 
			user-friendly and intuitive interface. I wrote it in c++ using gcc compiler, Asus monitor, and human fingers.
			The second is Good Bye world. While it may not be as widely known as Hello World, it still offers the EXACT 
			same amount of utility that the hello world program offers. I wrote this in Java using some coffee grounds I 
			found at the bottom of my Starbucks cup. I compiled it myself with a straw. I too am thinking of expanding 
			on my Hello World program and turning it into a multi-greeting, synchronized planetary operating system based
			off the not widely known Iinux kernel (which I also made by hand using binary found in the background of the 
			Matrix (the first), specifically minutes 22 thru 34 as a base.) I've yet to compile my binary into assembly, 
			and then compile the assembly into c++ so that I can finally recompile into an exe, but when I do... I'll be 
			rich! I'm going to name the OS Look Out World, or LOW for short. So look out world, there will be a new LOW 
			coming from me soon!!

            Who else missed the old bladee talking about swords, magic, games and just shit that doesn’t fucking exist 
			haha. It was so goofy but he made it sound so good. I was listening to his Plastic Boy verse and really made 
			me think how his style of lyrics changed.

            Bunch of swedish nobodies turned me into a total faggot. Now all i do is spend my time on this sub sucking on 
			the tit of unreleased songs and reading fan fictions of bladees pussy. I want to be normal again, I want to turn 
			on the radio and not automatically hate whatever the song is that comes on. FUCK. I miss getting the aux at 
			parties and not disappointing everyone by playing a bladee song. I went to the yung lean concert and it was 
			easily the worst night of my life, bunch of fat sweaty minorities pushed up against one another, a fucking 
			Vietnamese dude tried to stab me. FUCK yung lean!!!!
